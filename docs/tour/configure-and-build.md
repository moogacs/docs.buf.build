We'll start our tour by configuring `buf` and building the `.proto` files that define
the pet store API, which specifies a way to create, get, and delete pets in the store.

Clone the [`bufbuild/buf-tour`](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf-tour.git) repository
from GitHub and navigate to the `petapis` directory, which contains the pet store's
`.proto` files:

```terminal
$ git clone https://github.com/bufbuild/buf-tour.git
$ cd buf-tour/start/petapis
```

## 1.1 Configure `buf` {#configure-buf}

`buf` is configured with a [`buf.yaml`](../configuration/v1/buf-yaml.md) file, which you can
create with this command:

```terminal
$ buf mod init
```

After you run this command, you'll notice a `buf.yaml` in the current directory with the
following content:

```yaml title="buf.yaml"
version: v1
breaking:
  use:
    - FILE
lint:
  use:
    - DEFAULT
```

In `buf`'s default input mode, it assumes there is a `buf.yaml` in your current directory, or uses
the default values in lieu of a `buf.yaml` file. We recommend always having a `buf.yaml` file at the
root of your `.proto` files hierarchy, as this is how `.proto` import paths are resolved.

For those of you that have used `protoc`, the placement of the `buf.yaml` is analogous to a `protoc`
include (`-I`) path. **With `buf`, there is no `-I` flag** - each `protoc` `-I` path maps to a directory
that contains a `buf.yaml` (called a [module](../bsr/overview.md#modules) in Buf parlance), and multiple modules
are stitched together with a [`buf.work.yaml`](../configuration/v1/buf-work-yaml.md), which defines a
[workspace](../reference/workspaces.md).

We'll cover workspaces when working with multiple roots later in the tour, but to illustrate how all these pieces
fit together here's a quick example using `protoc` and its equivalent in `buf`:

```terminal
$ protoc \
    -I proto \
    -I vendor/protoc-gen-validate \
    -o /dev/null \
    $(find proto -name '*.proto')
```

A `buf.yaml` would be placed in the `proto` and `vendor/protoc-gen-validate` directories, and you would define
a `buf.work.yaml` that contains this:

```sh
.
├── buf.work.yaml
├── proto
│   ├── acme
│   │   └── weather
│   │       └── v1
│   │           └── weather.proto
│   └── buf.yaml
└── vendor
    └── protoc-gen-validate
        ├── buf.yaml
        └── validate
            └── validate.proto
```

```yaml title="buf.work.yaml"
version: v1
directories:
  - proto
  - vendor/protoc-gen-validate
```

For now, we'll stick to the `buf.yaml` we created above.

## 1.2 Build the API {#build-the-api}

Before we continue, let's verify that everything is set up properly:

```terminal
$ buf build
```

The above command should have exit code 0 and no output (you can check the exit code by
running `echo $?`). This means that all of the `.proto` files defined in the current
directory successfully compile.

Plus, you can see some interesting details about the compiled artifact with a few flags and
[jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq). This command displays a list of the Protobuf packages used
in this project:

```terminal
$ buf build --exclude-source-info -o -#format=json | jq '.file[] | .package'
---
"google.protobuf"
"google.type"
"pet.v1"
```

As you can see from the output, these packages are used in the project:

Package name | Meaning
:------------|:-------
`google.protobuf` | A dependency on the [Well-Known Types](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf)
`google.type` | A dependency on a Google API
`pet.v1` | The pet store API itself

We'll come back to the `pet.v1` package later.
