title: 3 Lint Your API
---

You can run all of the configured lint rules by running this command:

```terminal
$ buf lint
---
google/type/datetime.proto:17:1:Package name "google.type" should be suffixed with a correctly formed version, such as "google.type.v1".
pet/v1/pet.proto:44:10:Field name "petID" should be lower_snake_case, such as "pet_id".
pet/v1/pet.proto:49:9:Service name "PetStore" should be suffixed with "Service".
```

As you can see, the current pet store API has a few lint failures across both of its
files. These failures belong to the [`DEFAULT`](../lint/rules.md#default) lint category
configured in the [`buf.yaml`](../configuration/v1/buf-yaml.md):

```yaml title="buf.yaml"
version: v1
breaking:
  use:
    - FILE
lint:
  use:
    - DEFAULT
```

You can also output lint failures as JSON:

```terminal
$ buf lint --error-format=json
---
{"path":"google/type/datetime.proto","start_line":17,"start_column":1,"end_line":17,"end_column":21,"type":"PACKAGE_VERSION_SUFFIX","message":"Package name \"google.type\" should be suffixed with a correctly formed version, such as \"google.type.v1\"."}
{"path":"pet/v1/pet.proto","start_line":44,"start_column":10,"end_line":44,"end_column":15,"type":"FIELD_LOWER_SNAKE_CASE","message":"Field name \"petID\" should be lower_snake_case, such as \"pet_id\"."}
{"path":"pet/v1/pet.proto","start_line":49,"start_column":9,"end_line":49,"end_column":17,"type":"SERVICE_SUFFIX","message":"Service name \"PetStore\" should be suffixed with \"Service\"."}
```

## 3.1 Lint exceptions {#lint-exceptions}

The [`DEFAULT`](/lint/rules#default) lint category failures come from these rules:

* [`PACKAGE_VERSION_SUFFIX`](../lint/rules.md#package_version_suffix)
* [`FIELD_LOWER_SNAKE_CASE`](../lint/rules.md#field_lower_snake_case)
* [`SERVICE_SUFFIX`](../lint/rules.md#service_suffix)

To make `buf` happy, you can exclude these rules from the `DEFAULT` category by adding them to the
[`except`](/lint/configuration#except) list in your lint configuration:

```yaml title="buf.yaml" {8-11}
 version: v1
 breaking:
   use:
     - FILE
 lint:
   use:
     - DEFAULT
+  except:
+    - PACKAGE_VERSION_SUFFIX
+    - FIELD_LOWER_SNAKE_CASE
+    - SERVICE_SUFFIX
```

Now if you run `buf lint` again, you'll notice that it's successful (exit code 0 and no output):

```terminal
$ buf lint
```

Silencing failures by eliminating lint rules using `except` is usually **not** recommended,
although it may be unavoidable in some situations; it's almost always better to actually _fix_
the lint failures. You can restore the `buf.yaml` to its previous state with these config changes:

```yaml title="buf.yaml" {8-11}
 version: v1
 breaking:
   use:
     - FILE
 lint:
   use:
     - DEFAULT
-  except:
-    - PACKAGE_VERSION_SUFFIX
-    - FIELD_LOWER_SNAKE_CASE
-    - SERVICE_SUFFIX
```

## 3.2 Fix lint failures {#fix-lint-failures}

Start by fixing the lint failures for the `pet/v1/pet.proto` file, which stem from the `FIELD_LOWER_SNAKE_CASE`
and `SERVICE_SUFFIX` rules. `buf` indicates exactly what you need to change to fix the errors, so you can
fix the failures with these updates:

```protobuf title="pet/v1/pet.proto" {10-11,16-17}
 syntax = "proto3";

 package pet.v1;

 option go_package = "github.com/bufbuild/buf-tour/petstore/gen/proto/go/pet/v1;petv1";

...

 message DeletePetRequest {
-  string petID = 1;
+  string pet_id = 1;
 }

 message DeletePetResponse {}

-service PetStore {
+service PetStoreService {
   rpc GetPet(GetPetRequest) returns (GetPetResponse) {}
   rpc PutPet(PutPetRequest) returns (PutPetResponse) {}
   rpc DeletePet(DeletePetRequest) returns (DeletePetResponse) {}
 }
```

You can verify that two of the failures are resolved by linting again and seeing only one remaining error:

```terminal
$ buf lint
---
google/type/datetime.proto:17:1:Package name "google.type" should be suffixed with a correctly formed version, such as "google.type.v1".
```

## 3.3 Ignore lint failures {#ignore-lint-failures}

The `google/type/datetime.proto` isn't actually a file in your local project. Instead, it's one of your
dependencies, provided by [googleapis](https://buf.build/googleapis/googleapis), so you can't change its
`package` declaration to satisfy `buf`'s lint requirements. You can `ignore` the `google/type/datetime.proto`
file from `buf lint` like with this config update:

```yaml title="buf.yaml" {8-9}
 version: v1
 breaking:
   use:
     - FILE
 lint:
   use:
     - DEFAULT
+  ignore:
+    - google/type/datetime.proto
```

Alternatively, you can specify exactly which rules to ignore using the [`ignore_only`](/lint/configuration#ignore_only)
parameter. You can output failures in a format that you can then copy into your `buf.yaml` file. This enables you to ignore
all existing lint errors and correct them over time:

```terminal
$ buf lint --error-format=config-ignore-yaml
---
version: v1
lint:
  ignore_only:
    PACKAGE_VERSION_SUFFIX:
      - google/type/datetime.proto
```

In this case, you don't own the `google/type/datetime.proto` file, so it's best to `ignore` it altogether.

## 3.4 Remote inputs {#remote-inputs}

The `buf lint` command also works with remote inputs, using the local `buf.yaml` configuration. For example, you can see all
the original lint failures if you reference a `tar.gz` archive from the `main` branch:

```terminal
$ buf lint "https://github.com/bufbuild/buf-tour/archive/main.tar.gz#strip_components=1,subdir=start/petapis" --config buf.yaml
---
start/petapis/pet/v1/pet.proto:44:10:Field name "petID" should be lower_snake_case, such as "pet_id".
start/petapis/pet/v1/pet.proto:49:9:Service name "PetStore" should be suffixed with "Service".
```

> The `strip_components` option specifies the number of directories to strip for `tar` or `zip` inputs.

> For remote locations that require authentication, see [HTTPS Authentication](../reference/inputs.md#https) and
> [SSH Authentication](../reference/inputs.md#ssh) for more details.
