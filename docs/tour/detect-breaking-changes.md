title: 4 Detect Breaking Changes
---

You can detect [breaking changes][breaking] between different versions of your API. `buf` is able to
detect these categories of breaking changes:

- [`FILE`](../breaking/rules.md#categories)
- [`PACKAGE`](../breaking/rules.md#categories)
- [`WIRE`][wire]
- [`WIRE_JSON`](../breaking/rules.md#categories)

The default value is `FILE`, which we recommend to guarantee maximum compatibility across consumers
of your APIs. We generally suggest choosing only one of these options rather than
including/excluding specific breaking change rules, as you would when specifying a [linting]
configuration. Your `buf.yaml` file currently has the `FILE` option configured:

```yaml title="buf.yaml"
version: v1
lint:
  use:
    - DEFAULT
breaking:
  use:
    - FILE
```

## 4.1 Break Your API {#break-your-api}

Next, you'll need to introduce a breaking change. First, make a change that's breaking at the
[`WIRE`][wire] level. This is the most fundamental type of breaking change as it changes how the
Protobuf messages are encoded in transit ("on the wire"). This type of breaking change affects
_all_ users in _all_ languages.

For example, change the type of the `Pet.pet_type` field from `PetType` to `string`:

```protobuf title=pet/v1/pet.proto {2-3}
 message Pet {
-  PetType pet_type = 1;
+  string pet_type = 1;
   string pet_id = 2;
   string name = 3;
 }
```

## 4.2 Run `buf breaking` {#run-buf-breaking}

Now, you can verify that this is a breaking change against the local `main` branch. You'll also
notice errors related to the changes you made in the [previous step](lint-your-api.md):

```terminal
$ buf breaking --against ../../.git#branch=main,subdir=start/petapis
---
pet/v1/pet.proto:1:1:Previously present service "PetStore" was deleted from file.
pet/v1/pet.proto:20:3:Field "1" on message "Pet" changed type from "enum" to "string".
pet/v1/pet.proto:44:3:Field "1" with name "pet_id" on message "DeletePetRequest" changed option "json_name" from "petID" to "petId".
pet/v1/pet.proto:44:10:Field "1" on message "DeletePetRequest" changed name from "petID" to "pet_id".
```

Similarly, you can target a [`zip`][zip] archive from the remote repository:

```terminal
$ buf breaking \
  --against "https://github.com/bufbuild/buf-tour/archive/main.zip#strip_components=1,subdir=start/petapis" \
  --config buf.yaml
---
pet/v1/pet.proto:1:1:Previously present service "PetStore" was deleted from file.
pet/v1/pet.proto:20:3:Field "1" on message "Pet" changed type from "enum" to "string".
pet/v1/pet.proto:44:3:Field "1" with name "pet_id" on message "DeletePetRequest" changed option "json_name" from "petID" to "petId".
pet/v1/pet.proto:44:10:Field "1" on message "DeletePetRequest" changed name from "petID" to "pet_id".
```

## 4.3 Revert Changes {#revert-changes}

Once you've determined that your change is breaking, revert it:

```protobuf title=pet/v1/pet.proto {2-3}
 message Pet {
-  string pet_type = 1;
+  PetType pet_type = 1;
   string pet_id = 2;
   string name = 3;
 }
```

## 4.4 Read an Image from stdin {#read-an-image-from-stdin}

Like all other `buf` commands, [`buf breaking`][breaking] can read input from stdin. This is useful
if, for example, you're downloading an [Image](../reference/images.md) from a private location. As a
fun example, let's build an image out of our current state, write it to stdout, then compare against
the input from stdin. This should _always_ pass, as it compares the current state to the current
state:

```terminal
$ buf build -o - | buf breaking --against -
```
